It’s not final and might change.<br/>Gets the render operation of an existing project that was requested to render. Meant to be used to check the status of an ongoing render operation following a successful request to render a project. A render operation can be in one of the following states: InProgress/Cancelling/Succeeded/Failed/Canceled:<br/>The state 'InProgress' is a non-terminal state that means the render operation is in progress, and cancellation can be requested using the cancellation API. While in this state, the project is render-locked, meaning until the render completes or cancellation is requested the project's video ranges can't be updated and it's not allowed to request render.<br/>The state 'Cancelling' is a non-terminal state that means that cancellation was requested for the render operation but it hasn't completed yet. In this state the project is no longer render-locked, so its video ranges can be updated and it's allowed to request render. From this state the project doesn't necessarily transition to the 'Canceled' state, since it's possible render already completed by the time the cancellation request was acknowledged.<br/>The state 'Canceled' is a terminal state that means that cancellation was requested for the render operation and the cancellation completed.<br/>The state 'Failed' is a terminal state that means that the render operation has completed with failure during processing. In that case the response body will contain error information.<br/>The state 'Succeeded' is a terminal state that means that the render operation has completed successfully. In that case the response body will contain the operation's result. A project is referred to as a rendered project if it has a render operation in this state.",
